\section{Cool Results}
In building upon upon what was built in assignment 1, our car can execute a multi-point turn. We enter a J-turn state that turns the car around. The boolean transition occurs when the car deviates from the plan by more than 100 degrees as described in sec. \ref{replan}. It then executes the J-turn, and then replans following the same A* implementation. It then follows the plan accordingly. Moreover, our implementation is fast enough that it is able to run normally at $2 m/s$, and then runs the J-turn maneuver at slower preset speeds. This can be seen all together in sec. \ref{wowus} of sec. \ref{vids}
