\section{Challenges}

One challenge we had was balancing this assignment with the group's Thanksgiving plans. Two of us already had plans to leave Austin before the deadline, which made planning out our work and wrapping up the assignment more difficult. We also spent a tremendous amount of time tuning and trying out different reward function formulations to enable better obstacle avoidance at run time. 

\section{Chosen Integrations}
We used the bumper car group's particle filter and our own obstacle avoidance implementation from assignment 1. See sec. \ref{integ} for more information. 

\section{Contributions}

The whole group made an effort to contribute to this assignment equally. Arnav and Josh spent more time on the global planner and on integration with the particle filter due to Hayley's upcoming conference deadline. Arnav is the main contributor to integrating and updating the J-turn ability from assignment 1.
